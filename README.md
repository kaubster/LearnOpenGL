Forked this repo to follow along with excellent tutorials. Special thanks to JoeyDeVries and his site LearnOpenGL.

To build, append SOIL.lib as an link dependency (properties->Linker->Additional Dependencies) to each of the following:
7.in_practice
    1.debugging
    2.setting_up
    3.rendering_sprites
    4.levels
    5.1.ball
    5.2.collision_detection
    5.3.collision_resolution
    6.particles
    7.postprocessing
    8.powerups
    9.audio
    10.render_text
	

# Need to update CMakeLists.txt to fix the need to update link dependencies or copy SOIL.lib
